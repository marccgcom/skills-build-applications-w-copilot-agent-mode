# Commit and Push OctoFit Django Backend Updates

1. Analyze all changes made to the Django backend in the branch (including models, serializers, views, admin, urls, tests, and settings).
2. Write a clear, descriptive commit message summarizing the new features and improvements (e.g., REST API endpoints for users, teams, activities, leaderboard, workouts; MongoDB/Djongo integration; CORS; admin registration; tests).
3. Stage all relevant files, commit with the message, and push to the current branch.
